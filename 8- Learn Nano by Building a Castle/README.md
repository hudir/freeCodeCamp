There it is. Nano is a program for editing files that runs in the terminal. You can open a file with nano filename. Open the castle.sh file you created with Nano.


The terminal is showing your file in Nano. At the bottom are the commands you can use. Your file is empty right now. Add echo hello nano at the top and press control + o to "write-out", or save, the file. You will be prompted at the bottom for a filename. Leave it as castle.sh and press enter to save the file.
